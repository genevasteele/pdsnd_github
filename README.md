# **Geneva's Bikeshare Python Project**

### Description
This project takes csv files from 3 different cities and allows the user to navigate through a series of prompts to discover statistics about the bikeshare programs in those cities.

The user selects:
-The city
-If they want to filter by month
    -if so, then the month
-If they want to filter by day
    -if so, then the day

    The project then offers to scroll through lines of raw data related to the user's selections.
